<p>Here are seven very simple but effective ways I've learned over the years for dealing productively with disagreement.</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		<p><h5>Seek to understand.</h5> People tend to disagree when they don't understand each other. When one party is so busy wanting to be heard and doesn't spend any time trying to understand, disagreement is right around the corner. When you come to an understanding that most of us are more alike then we are different, you can begin to tolerate and accommodate even appreciate a different point of view. So first, seek to understand and appreciate. That does not mean you have to agree, just that you're open to hearing them out.</p>

			<h5>Look beyond your own triggers.</h5> Many disagreements stem from someone being triggered by something that's been said. What's triggered is usually fear and awareness of one's limitations. Whatever may have happened in your past, you have to find a way to get past your triggers and see that you're in a new situation with a person who doesn't mean you harm.

			<h5>Look for similarities, not differences.</h5>From working with my clients, I've found that the best way to begin resolving a disagreement is to look for common ground. When you concentrate on differences the space grows wider, but when you seek out what you have in common it helps bridge the gap. The next time you find yourself in a disagreement, look for a point of agreement--even if you have to stretch.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p> <h5>Be a good listener.</h5> In any disagreement, it's important for both parties to be heard. And that means it's important to be a good listener-- curious, open minded and nonjudgmental. A good listener gives their full attention, asks for clarification when necessary, and can listen to different opinions without becoming defensive or argumentative.  The best way to listen is to be silent. That's when you can learn.</p>

		 <h5>Take responsibility for your own feelings.</h5><p>Especially in heated disagreements, it's easy to start making accusations, laying blame and making excuses. To work through it, you have to be honest with yourself and take full responsibility for your own feelings, and for your interpretations that may have contributed to the breakdown.

			<h5>Make a commitment.</h5>In times of intense disagreement, it's not uncommon for one or both parties to have one foot out the door. If you want to truly get to the heart of the matter, make sure the other person understands your commitment to the relationship. Even if you have an issue with the behavior, you have to keep that separate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><h5>Use positive language.</h5> No one wants to be called names or to be called out in a negative way, or to hear all the bad things they have done in the past. If you are speak in negatives, you will hurt the person and shut them down. if you can bring positivity to what you are trying to say, it's far more likely that you'll be heard, and that the disagreement can be resolved more quickly and easily.</p>

<h4>Tips for managing and resolving conflict</h4>
<h6>Managing and resolving conflict requires emotional maturity, self­control, and empathy. It can 
be tricky, frustrating, and even frightening. You can ensure that the process is as positive as
possible by sticking to the following conflict resolution guidelines:</h6>
<ol>
<h5>Make the relationship your priority.</h5> 
<p>Maintaining and strengthening the relationship, rather than “winning” the argument, should always be your first priority. </p>
<h5>Be respectful of the other person and his or her viewpoint.</h5>
<h5>Focus on the present.</h5> 
<p>If you’re holding on to old hurts and resentments, your ability to see
the reality of the current situation will be impaired. Rather than looking to the past and 
assigning blame, focus on what you can do in the here­and­now to solve the problem.</p>
<h5>Pick your battles.</h5> <p>Conflicts can be draining, so it’s important to consider whether the issue 
is really worthy of your time and energy. Maybe you don't want to surrender a parking space 
if you’ve been circling for 15 minutes. But if there are dozens of spots, arguing over a single 
space isn’t worth it.</p> 
<h5>Be willing to forgive.</h5>
<p>Resolving conflict is impossible if you’re unwilling or unable to 
forgive. Resolution lies in releasing the urge to punish, which can never compensate for our
losses and only adds to our injury by further depleting and draining our lives.</p> 
<h5>Know when to let something go.</h5>
<p>If you can’t come to an agreement, agree to disagree. It 
takes two people to keep an argument going. If a conflict is going nowhere, you can choose 
to disengage and move on.</p>
<h5>Remain calm.</h5>
<p>Try not to overreact to difficult situations. By remaining calm it will be more likely that others will consider your viewpoint. </p>
<h5>Express feelings in words, not actions.</h5>
<p>Telling someone directly and honestly how you feel can be a very powerful form of communication. If you start to feel so angry or upset that you feel you may lose control, take a "time out" and do something to help yourself feel steadier.</p>
<h5>Be specific about what is bothering you.</h5>
<p>Vague complaints are hard to work on.</p>
<h5>Deal with only one issue at a time.</h5> 
<p>Don't introduce other topics until each is fully discussed.
This avoids the "kitchen sink" effect where people throw in all their complaints while not 
allowing anything to be resolved.</p>
<h5>No "hitting below the belt." </h5>
<p>Attacking areas of personal sensitivity creates an atmosphere of
distrust, anger, and vulnerability. Avoid accusations. Accusations will cause others to defend themselves. Instead, talk about how someone's actions made you feel.</p>
<h5>Don't generalize. </h5>
<p>Avoid words like "never" or "always." Such generalizations are usually 
inaccurate and will heighten tensions. </p>
<h5>Avoid "make believe."</h5> 
<p>Exaggerating or inventing a complaint ­ or your feelings about it ­ will prevent the real issues from surfacing. Stick with the facts and your honest feelings. </p>
<h5>Don't stockpile. </h5>
<p>Storing up lots of grievances and hurt feelings over time is counterproductive. 
It's almost impossible to deal with numerous old problems for which interpretations may differ.
Try to deal with problems as they arise.</p>
<h5>Avoid clamming up.</h5>
<p>When one person becomes silent and stops responding to the other,
frustration and anger can result. Positive results can only be attained with two­way 
communication. </p>
